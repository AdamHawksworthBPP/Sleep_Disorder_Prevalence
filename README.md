## Lifestyle factors, health metrics and sleep disorder prevalence

This project explores how some lifestyle factors and health metrics correlate to the likelihood of a person having a sleeping disorder. Good quality sleep is vital to ensuring a long and healthy life so itâ€™s detrimental to public health that the prevalence of sleep disorders is on the rise. Although this analysis cannot prove causation, understanding the variables that correlate with sleep disorders can guide interventions to promote healthy habits and prevent sleep disturbances, improving overall well-being.
